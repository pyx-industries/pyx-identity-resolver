# Introduction

The Pyx Identity Resolver is a system designed to manage and resolve links associated with various identifiers, such as GTINs (Global Trade Item Numbers).

It provides a flexible solution for identity registry operators or identifier owners to register and manage links to more information about a product.

This system enables value chain actors to resolve and access this information across different identifier schemes, enhancing traceability and data accessibility throughout the supply chain.

## Core Functionality

- Identifier scheme management (registering and configuring identifier schemes for link registration and resolution)
- Link registration and management (allowing registry operators or identifier owners to add and update links to product information)
- Link resolution (enabling value chain actors to access additional information linked to identifiers across various identifier schemes)

## Standards Compliance

- [ISO 18975](https://www.iso.org/standard/85540.html) for link resolution
- [RFC 9264](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9264) for link sets
- [GS1 Digital Link](https://ref.gs1.org/standards/digital-link/1.1.3/) for resolving GS1 identifiers
